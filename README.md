## 💻 How to Run This Project Locally

Follow these steps to download, host, and run the project on your local computer.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
You will need a local server environment to run PHP and MySQL. We recommend using **XAMPP**.
1. Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules from the XAMPP Control Panel.

### 📥 Step 1: Download the Project
1. Scroll to the top of this repository.
2. Click the **Code** button and select **Download ZIP**.
3. Extract the downloaded folder.
4. Rename the folder to `sticker-shop` (or your preferred name).
5. Move the folder to your local server directory:
   - **XAMPP:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
   - **WAMP:** `C:\wamp\www\`
   - **MAMP:** `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`

### 🗄️ Step 2: Setup the Database
1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
2. Click on the **Databases** tab.
3. Create a new database (e.g., name it `sticker_shop_db`).
4. Click on the newly created database on the left sidebar.
5. Click the **Import** tab in the top menu.
6. Click **Choose File** and locate the `.sql` file inside the project folder you downloaded (look for a folder named `database` or a file ending in `.sql`).
7. Click **Go** at the bottom of the page to import the tables.

### ⚙️ Step 3: Configure Connection (If necessary)
*Note: If the project has a database connection file (usually named `config.php`, `db.php`, or `connection.php`), make sure the database name inside that file matches the name of the database you just created in Step 2.*

### 🚀 Step 4: Run the Website
1. Open your web browser.
2. Type the following in the address bar:
   `http://localhost/index.php`.
